# Introduction

## Welcome!

The Gutenberg WordPress project uses Storybook to view and work with user interface components developed in WordPress packages, especially with [@wordpress/components](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components).

On this interactive site, you can view individual components, their controls, options, and settings individually. You can also change the controls and arguments and see the changes immediately.

The components or entire blocks presented on this site can be used in your code to create an editor user interface for your custom blocks or other pages.

## How this site works

The side panel of the site displays individual components, and on the right is a canvas. Select the component you want to explore and you will see it displayed on the Canvas tab. If the component also has controls/arguments, you can change them on the Controls tab at the bottom of the screen.

To view the documentation for each component, use the "Documents" menu item on the top toolbar.

You can also view the source code, open the Source Code tab in the sidebar and view the component or block files, as well as the components are made in two languages, JavaScript and Typescript,

To view the source code of the component and its history on GitHub, click <InlineIcon icon ="repository" /> View the source code of the repository in the upper right corner.

```bash
npm run sb
```

To use this project as a theme for your Wordpress, download this archive to yourself and transfer it to your /themes folder, then activate the theme and Gutenberg blocks are ready to use, but before that run the command.

```bash
npm run build
```
